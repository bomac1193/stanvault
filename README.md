**What Matters Stays**

---

## The Problem

Music discovery is broken. TikTok virality doesn't translate to lasting artist careers—songs spike and vanish. Streaming algorithms optimize for engagement, not resonance. The result: artists chase viral moments that evaporate, listeners drown in infinite scroll, and music that deserves to endure gets buried under the next 15-second trend.

The numbers tell the story:

- **75%** of Gen Z discover music on TikTok, but only **31%** ever add those songs to their libraries
- Podcasters earn **3x more** than short-form creators because long-form builds loyalty
- **63%** of Gen Z planned social media breaks in 2024—they're exhausted by algorithmic manipulation
- "Brain rot" became Oxford's 2024 Word of the Year

Meanwhile, the **$4.5 billion superfan market gap** remains untapped because platforms can't distinguish between a song someone heard once on a playlist and a song that changed their life.

## What Stanvault Does

Stanvault measures **hold rate**—whether music stays in your life over weeks and months—not just whether it spiked initially. We surface music with lasting cultural resonance, not viral-then-forgotten noise.

**Core features:**

- **Hold metrics**: Track how long songs stay in regular rotation (30, 90, 365 days)
- **Slow discovery**: One thoughtfully curated recommendation per day—friction as feature
- **Human curation**: Community playlists from verified superfans, not engagement-optimized algorithms
- **Long-form listening**: Albums and extended experiences over singles
- **Impact scores**: Artists see which songs have lasting resonance vs. viral decay

## Guiding Policy

**Depth over virality.** Every product decision prioritizes lasting cultural impact over momentary engagement. We reject the attention economy's premise that more time-on-platform equals better outcomes. Music that matters deserves infrastructure that measures what matters.

## Strategy

### 1. Anti-Algorithm Positioning

Position explicitly against "brainrot" and engagement optimization. This cultural stance is our moat—Spotify and TikTok cannot adopt it without contradicting their core business models. We appeal directly to documented Gen Z desire for authenticity and escape from algorithmic manipulation.

### 2. Premium Subscription Only

No free tier with ads. The absence of advertising IS the product. This creates a self-selecting community of intentional listeners and ensures our incentives align with user satisfaction, not engagement maximization.

## Why Incumbents Can't Copy This

Spotify's recommendation system is built to maximize time-on-platform. Switching to hold-rate metrics would cannibalize their core KPIs. TikTok's value proposition is virality—slow discovery contradicts their entire model. The cultural positioning as "anti-brainrot" directly attacks their product philosophy.

They're structurally dependent on the status quo. We're not.
