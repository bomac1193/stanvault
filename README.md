**Own Your Fans. Own Your Future.**

---

## Who This Is For

- **Independent artists** who want to know their real fans, not just follower counts
- **Artists tired of renting audiences** from algorithms that change overnight
- **Fans who want their loyalty to mean something** beyond a Spotify wrapped stat

## Who This Is NOT For

- Artists chasing viral moments over lasting careers
- Anyone who thinks follower count = fan relationship
- Platforms that profit from keeping artists and fans apart

---

## The Problem

Artists don't own their fan relationships. Spotify knows your superfans better than you do—and won't tell you. Labels see streaming numbers, not humans. When the algorithm changes, your "audience" vanishes because it was never yours.

The **$4.5B superfan economy** exists, but artists can't access it because they can't identify, verify, or communicate with their most dedicated fans.

## What Stanvault Does

A **Fan Intelligence Platform** that gives artists ownership of their fan relationships and gives fans ownership of their identity.

**For Artists:**
- **Stan Score**: Algorithmic ranking of fan dedication (streams, saves, follows, longevity)
- **Stan Conversion Rate (SCR)**: Measure how efficiently you turn listeners into superfans
- **Fan Verification Protocol**: Cryptographic proof of fan status for presales, Discord, merch

**For Fans:**
- **Portable Fan Identity**: Export your verified listening history in industry-standard formats
- **Self-Service Verification Tokens**: Prove your superfan status anywhere without re-verifying
- **Own Your Data**: Your fan relationships belong to you, not platforms

## Guiding Policy

**Depth over virality. Ownership over access.**

Every decision prioritizes lasting fan relationships over momentary engagement metrics. We reject the premise that artists should rent their audiences from algorithms. Fans are not data points—they're relationships worth owning.

## The Moat

**Two-sided data network effect:**

1. **Fan Identity Protocol** — Fans own portable, cryptographically-signed credentials. Spotify can't offer this (they lock data in).

2. **Cross-Artist Fan Graph** — Relationship data across the ecosystem. "Fans of A became superfans of B." No single artist or platform has this.

3. **Structural Conflict** — Spotify's model is artist-agnostic streaming. Labels don't have direct fan relationships. CRMs are single-artist tools. None can copy a two-sided marketplace.

4. **Verification Network** — Every ticket vendor, Discord bot, or merch site that integrates increases switching costs.

**The more artists AND fans join, the harder it is to replicate.**
