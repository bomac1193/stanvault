# Font Files

This directory should contain the following Futura font files:

- `FuturaBold.woff2` - Futura Bold for display headings
- `FuturaMedium.woff2` - Futura Medium for taglines and emphasis

## Obtaining Futura

Futura is a commercial typeface. You can obtain licensed versions from:

1. **Adobe Fonts** - Included with Creative Cloud subscription
2. **MyFonts** - https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura/
3. **Fonts.com** - https://www.fonts.com/font/linotype/futura

## Alternative Free Fonts

If licensing Futura is not feasible, consider these alternatives:

- **Jost** (Google Fonts) - Free geometric sans-serif inspired by Futura
- **Nunito Sans** (Google Fonts) - Similar geometric proportions
- **Poppins** (Google Fonts) - Modern geometric sans-serif

To use Jost as a fallback, the CSS is already configured to fall back gracefully.
